# Planned additional features

1) Auto-Remove/Undo style scripts (where possible)
2) Install script package selection capabilities
3) Auto version detection of Lubuntu to reduce manual overhead
4) Ability to automatically offer firefox plugin addons for security features
5) Allow customised install scripts
6) Code optimisation (so 14.04 is merely a 'branch off' from the normal install, rather than a near-duplicate copy shell script)
7) Enable 64-bit/32-bit detection capabilities (specialised script to return value?)
8) Ability to install third party off-site DEB packages (EG Discord, Skype)
