# Lubuntu-AutoInstall
Development of auto-install scripts for Lubuntu.

# How to use
Download a copy of the files as a ZIP, extract to anywhere, then navigate into the now extracted Lubuntu-AutoInstall-master.

Open up a terminal (make sure it's in the same directory you navigated to), and:

If using 15.04 onwards, type:
sudo bash ./MasterInstall.sh

If using 14.04, type:
sudo bash ./MasterInstall_14_04.sh

If you only want to install specific configurations, navigate the terminal into the AutoInstall folder, and type in:

sudo bash ./NAME_OF_SCRIPT_HERE.sh

For example:
sudo bash ./GamingSuite.sh
